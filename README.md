# Tank Game
My project for the Boot.Dev 2025 Hackathon

I've always wanted to make a game like Wii Tanks, and this hackathon gave me an excuse to. I'm extremely proud of myself for what I was able to accomplish in such a short time.

HOW TO INSTALL: 
I've used Pyinstaller to get the whole game into one executable. Go to releases and download the exe, and you're all set!

CONTROLS:
WASD to move, aim with your mouse, and left-click to shoot!

THE GAME:
Defeat all the enemy tanks. The game is endless, every level is randomly generated based on premade layouts, which are drawn pixel by pixel and turned into maps with NumPy and PIL. There are 15 unique maps, 6 unique enemy tanks, and 3 bosses. The game will prorassively get harder the farther you get, as you will encounter more difficult tanks, and enemies will start with more and more health as you go.
